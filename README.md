# The Coding Gauntlet

## Description
This is an educational game that asks multiple choice questions that may be seen on coding assessments. When the user answers the first question, a timer begins counting down from 60, decrementing each second. If a question is answered incorrectly, the counter decreases by 7. At the end of the game, the users score equals the time remaining in the countdown. The user can then enter their name which is stored in a local database and displayed on the leaderboard.
